2048-Python 
==================
Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/Jaidev810/2048-Game) by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. Here is a Python version that uses TKinter!

-----------------
To start the game, run:

    $ python3 2048.py
